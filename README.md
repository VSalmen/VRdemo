MainActivity suggests possible train stations available for commercial use. The suggestions update as you start typing. You can select the station from the list or by typing and activating search.

The source code is full of TODOs. Some of them are ideas for later development and some are just unhandled exceptions (well, they are handled but perhaps not in a ideal way).
